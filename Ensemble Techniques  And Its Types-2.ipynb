    "Bagging (Bootstrap Aggregating) is an ensemble technique that can be used to reduce overfitting in decision trees.\n",
    "\n",
    "Decision trees have a tendency to overfit the training data by creating complex trees that fit the noise in the data. Bagging helps to reduce overfitting by creating multiple bootstrap samples of the training data and building a separate decision tree on each sample. Each tree is trained on a different subset of the data, which helps to reduce the variance of the individual trees.\n",
    "\n",
    "During the training process, bagging randomly selects a subset of the features for each tree. This process helps to reduce the correlation among the individual trees, which in turn reduces the overall variance of the ensemble model. By combining the results of multiple decision trees trained on different subsets of the data and features, bagging produces a more stable and robust model that generalizes better to unseen data.\n",
    "\n",
    "When bagging decision trees, the final prediction is made by aggregating the predictions of all the trees. For regression problems, the predictions are usually averaged, while for classification problems, the most common prediction is taken as the final output."

    "Therefore, the optimal ensemble size in bagging depends on the specific problem and the characteristics of the data. In general, increasing the ensemble size can improve the predictive accuracy of the model up to a certain point, after which further increasing the ensemble size may not provide much additional benefit and may even lead to decreased performance due to overfitting.\n",

    "A commonly used rule of thumb is to set the ensemble size to the square root of the number of instances in the training data. However, this is not always optimal and it is recommended to experiment with different ensemble sizes to find the optimal one for the specific problem.\n",

    "In practice, it is common to use hundreds or even thousands of base learners in bagging, as computational resources permit. However, the number of base learners should be chosen carefully to balance the bias-variance tradeoff and prevent overfitting."

The researchers trained multiple decision tree classifiers on bootstrap samples of the training data, and combined the predictions of all the classifiers to obtain the final diagnosis. The bagging ensemble model achieved a classification accuracy of 96.7%, which was higher than the accuracy achieved by any of the individual decision tree classifiers.\n",

    "Another example is in the field of credit risk assessment, where bagging has been used to improve the accuracy of predictive models for credit risk. In a study published in the International Journal of Computational Intelligence and Applications, bagging was used to improve the accuracy of a classification model for predicting credit default. The researchers trained multiple logistic regression classifiers on bootstrap samples of the training data, and combined the predictions of all the classifiers to obtain the final prediction. The bagging ensemble model achieved a higher accuracy and lower error rate than the individual logistic regression classifiers.\n",
