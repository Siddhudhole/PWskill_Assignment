    "Abstraction is one of the fundamental concepts of object-oriented programming (OOP) and is used to hide the implementation details of a software component and present only the necessary information to the users. The goal of abstraction is to reduce complexity and increase robustness by allowing objects to be used in a manner that is independent of their internal structure.\n",

    "For example, consider a class that represents a shape in a graphics program. The class might have methods for calculating the area and perimeter of the shape. The exact implementation of these methods would depend on the specific type of shape (e.g., square, rectangle, circle, etc.). The shape class can be abstract, and the specific shapes can be created as concrete subclasses that inherit from the shape class and provide the appropriate implementation of the methods.\n",

This implementation can be encapsulated within the class, hiding the details from the user and exposing only the methods for depositing, withdrawing, and checking the balance.
